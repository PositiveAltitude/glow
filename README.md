# README

This repo contains all shared files related to "GLOW" Thust Vector Control model rocket. This model rocket is in prototype state and always will be, so everything is shared as is.

Currently, you can find STL here only files of thrust vector control mount. It is designed for SG-90 or MG-90 servo motors. I used M2.5 (I think) screws to fix servos and some cut nails to assemble everything else. To link servos I bent some nails and used them as a linkage. You also need to drill small holes in MotorTube and OuterFrame to connect the linkage. Not very robust but worked for me. You can figure out a better method :)
